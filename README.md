### !!! Attention !!!

We tried to fix all known bugs of Contenido 4.8 and earlier but cannot give any garanties for that. So use 
it on your own risk. If you find any bug or have any idea to enhance ConLite, feel free to visit our 
bugtracker at [https://gitport.de/ConLite/ConLite/issues](https://gitport.de/ConLite/ConLite/issues)
Any help and ideas are welcome :)

### Mini FAQ

#### What is ConLite?

CL (short for ConLite) is dedicated to close the gap between Contenido 4.8 and the version 4.10.
In downloadable 4.8.20 (and former 4.8.15) are still a lot of bugs and some missing feautures and 
enhancements so one cannot use the version without problems. Our goal is to give you a bugfixed and
really stable version of Contenido till the 4.9 or 4.10 is stable. By the way, there are still a lot of big sides 
build with 4.8.x out there where upgrading to 4.10.x is not possible or cost a lot of money.

#### Why i have to use ConLite?

You don't have to, but feel free to do it. ConLite will show you an easier way to upgrade step by step to Contenido 
4.10. The new version of Contenido has a lot of changes, so you have to do a lot of work
with modules or custom plugins to adapt them to the new version. That's not what ConLite does nor will 
do in the future. ConLite will do changes step by step, or better version by version to adapt your 
4.8.x or higher installation to work with the new 4.9 of Contenido. And ConLite will try to give you a 
stable and bugfixed Content-Management-System in the future.

#### Who are the people behind ConLite?

The Team behind the CL-version are some well known guys from CONTENIDO-forum, working since many years with
and within CONTENIDO core or coding modules and plugins for CONTENIDO. 
And we love CONTENIDO :)

### Know Bugs
FS#25 - Collision with pre-installed AMR after Migration
    !!! Attention !!!
    If you want to upgrade with an installed AMR-plugin, uninstall AMR before upgrade.
    We will include a fix for that in one of the next versions of CL
